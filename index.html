            Second, ridership data enables better planning for expansions, maintenance, and scheduling, ensuring that resources are allocated effectively. 
            Finally, analyzing peak usage times and popular routes provides commuter insights.
            The dashboard created from this analysis will be beneficial to multiple stakeholders. 
            Transit authorities can use it to make data-driven decisions to enhance services. Urban planners can identify areas requiring improvement and strategically plan upgrades.
            Meanwhile, the general public will find it a valuable tool for accessing quick insights into Metro usage, satisfying their curiosity.
        </p>
        <h5>How was it done?</h5>
        <p>The analysis makes use of interactive visualizations to explore ridership numbers troughout the years. The study focuses on addressing the following questions:
            <ul>
                <li>How has the usage of Metro services changed over time?</li><br>
                <p>This question seeks to uncover trends in ridership across different years, identifying periods of growth or decline and the potential factors influencing these changes.</p>
                <li>Do holidays affect usage?</li>
                <p>This question seeks to unciver if holidays like Christmas affect the usage patterns at all.</p>
                <li>What are the ridership patterns at individual stations?</li><br>
                <p>By analyzing station-level data, this inquiry aims to reveal variations in ridership, including peak usage times and consistently high-traffic stations, offering insights into localized commuting behaviors.</p>
                <li>What are the ridership patterns across modes (metro, bus)?</li>
                <p>Finally, the study tries to answer the question of ridership pattern accross metro rail and bus.</p>
            </ul> 
            <p>These initial directions of inquiry serve as the foundation for a deeper exploration of ridership dynamics, aiming to provide actionable insights for transit authorities, urban planners, and the general public.</p>
        </p>
        <h6>Data Collection</h6>
        <p>The data for this analysis was obtained from the WMATA Ridership Portal, a reliable source of historical and current ridership statistics for the Washington Metro system. The dataset includes comprehensive details about station-level ridership, allowing for an in-depth exploration of usage patterns. One particular dataset that had stationwise numbers was in a pdf format which was extracted manually and converted to csv. There were some records that had missing data especially in the stationwise ridership data. Since these records were crucial for representing the stations as nodes in the visualization, they couldn't be removed and hence were replaced with NA indicating there is no data for that station.
            The data acquired was tested against the criteria for good data and the results are as follows.
            <ol>
                <li>Accuracy - The data mostly seems to refelct actual ridership figures. However, further validation is needed to check for any outliers. Since the data is collected from the Metro farebox, it can be said the data is accurate.</li>
                <li>Completeness - The dataset appears to contain critical dimensions necessary for the analysis, such as station-level ridership numbers and temporal granularity (e.g., daily, monthly, or yearly data).</li>
                <li>Consistency - The data is consistent since it originates from a single source. There were no duplicate entries or conflicting records present in the dataset.</li>
                <li>Uniformity - The data seemed to be uniform since all the records followed the same format.</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        <h6>Data Analysis</h6>
        <p>Once the dataset was cleaned and validated for accuracy, completeness, consistency, and uniformity, it was utilized to create interactive visualizations that reveal insights into Metro ridership patterns. The primary aim was to analyze station-level ridership trends and represent them in a clear, visually appealing format.
            The main tools used were Excel to quickly read through the dataset. Python was used for the daily ridership visualization. Basic but essential libraries like pandas and plotly were used to read the data and create the visualization. For the visualization that shows ridership by stations, D3 which is a powerful JavaScript library was used.
            These tools enable an effective and powerful way to create the visualizations. 
        </p>
        <h6>Results</h6>
        <p>The interactive line chart provides an overview of ridership details from 2019 to 2024, showcasing trends and patterns across these years. Filters are available to highlight specific factors such as holidays and events that may have influenced ridership levels. By selecting the events filter, notable occurrences that impacted ridership are displayed. These include a peak in usage during the Cherry Blossom Festival in 2019, a significant drop due to COVID-19 restrictions in 2020, another decline during winter storms in January 2022, and surges in ridership associated with major political events. These insights help contextualize fluctuations in ridership within broader social and environmental events. Metro ridership typically drops during federal holidays. The graph shows that ridership did not significantly increase on Veterans Day, November 11, which fell on a Monday, and there is a noticeable decline during Thanksgiving. Also, the dashboard features a hover line that provides detailed descriptions for specific days, including ridership statistics, offering an interactive and informative way to explore the data. Bus ridership is represented in blue, while rail ridership is shown in red. In 2019, bus ridership was higher than rail ridership, but it experienced a decline during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. From 2020 through the end of 2022, bus usage consistently remained higher than rail usage. However, starting in 2023, there has been a notable increase in rail ridership</p>

            The metro map is a force-directed graph that was done using D3 JS. It shows a map of the DC Metro with nodes and links. Nodes represent a station and can be clicked on to get a tooltip that shows ridership for every year. Up top is a slider that allows the user to move through years. 
            Many DC Metro stations exhibit a gradual decline in ridership over the years, particularly between 2015 and 2017, reflecting broader shifts in commuting patterns or service usage. Despite this trend, central hubs like Union Station and Metro Center consistently maintain high ridership levels, driven by their strategic locations and strong connectivity to other lines and key city areas. In contrast, stations such as Rockville and Greenbelt demonstrate moderate yet steady usage, likely influenced by their role in serving residential communities. Among the various lines, the Red Line stands out as the most utilized, underscoring its importance as a primary commuter corridor within the metro system. These patterns highlight the diverse dynamics of station usage and the critical role of central and residential hubs in sustaining ridership.</p>
